# onos-gui
GUI for ONOS (µONOS Architecture)

onos-gui is the GUI application for all of the GUI functionality of µONOS.

It will provide GUI interfaces for all of the core projects such as
* [onos-config](docs/config-gui.md)
* onos-topo
* onos-control

For the moment (Jul '19) the Configuration GUI is the main target, but generally
the architecture will support UI extensions for any project, as libraries.

## Architecture
See [architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for an architectural discussion.

## Running the GUI
See [run.md](./docs/run.md) for how to run the GUI.
